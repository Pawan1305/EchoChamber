# **EchoChamber - AI That Evolves With Your Social Circle**

## **Project Overview**
EchoChamber is a dynamic AI-powered social platform that evolves based on the user's interactions. The platform allows users to interact with content (like commenting, liking, and sharing), and as they engage, their persona adapts and evolves over time. It also provides personalized content recommendations based on their interactions, creating a unique social experience.

This project consists of:
- **Backend (Node.js & MongoDB)**: Handles user profile creation and updates based on interactions, and stores user data and activity.
- **Frontend (React & Chart.js)**: Provides an interactive UI to update the user profile, show personalized content recommendations, and visualize the evolution of the user's persona over time.

## **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Persona Evolution**: As users interact more, their profile evolves.
- **Content/People Recommendations**: The system recommends content or people based on the user's current persona.
- **Profile Timeline**: A timeline to visualize how the user's profile has changed over time.
- **Interactivity**: Users can update their profiles through comments and other interactions.

## **Technologies Used**
